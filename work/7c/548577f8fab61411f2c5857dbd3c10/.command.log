1 Gene expression signature capturing the adenosine (ADO) pathway activity. This adenosine signature was significantly associated with reduced efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in published cohorts.\n
2 Gene expression signature capturing the antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM). This signature was predictor of response of ICB in non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma patients.
3                                                                                                      Gene expression signature capturing the antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM).
4                                      Gene expression signature capturing the B-cells activity. This B_cell signature was a predictor of the response of PD-(L)1 blockade in lung cancer patients.
5                                                      Gene expression signature capturing the B-cells activity. This B_cell signature was a predictor of the response of ICB in published cohorts.
6                                         Gene expression signature, derieved from whole-blood RNA-Sequencing, capturing the expression level of genes associated with response to CTLA-4 blockade.
